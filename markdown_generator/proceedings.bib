abstract = {Voice control provides hands-free access to computing, but there are many situations
where audible speech is not appropriate. Most unvoiced speech text entry systems can
not be used while on-the-go due to movement artifacts. SilentSpeller enables mobile
silent texting using a dental retainer with capacitive touch sensors to track tongue
movement. Users type by spelling words without voicing. In offline isolated word testing
on a 1164-word dictionary, SilentSpeller achieves an average 97% character accuracy.
97% offline accuracy is also achieved on phrases recorded while walking or seated.
Live text entry achieves up to 53 words per minute and 90% accuracy, which is competitive
with expert text entry on mini-QWERTY keyboards without encumbering the hands. },
