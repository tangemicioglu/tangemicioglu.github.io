A very busy October coming up! I will be a student volunteer at **UbiComp/ISWC 2023** in Cancun, while Mike Winters presents our [paper]((https://tangemicioglu.com/files/papers/TongueTap_ICMI_2023.pdf)) on multimodal tongue gesture recognition at **ICMI 2023**. Afterward, I'll be remotely assisting with our first SIGCHI Emerging Scholars workshop at **CSCW 2023**. Finally, David Martin will be in NYC to present our [poster](https://tangemicioglu.com/files/papers/FingerSpeller_ASSETS_2023_Poster.pdf) on fingerspelling with TapStrap at **ASSETS 2023**.
