Thanks to all who joined our workshop. Next, I'll be in Finland for **UbiComp 2025**, where I'll be presenting three projects: [BreathePulse](https://tangemicioglu.com/publications/#breathepulse-peripheral-guided-breathing-via-implicit-airflow-cues-for-information-work), [Passive Haptic Rehearsal](https://tangemicioglu.com/publications/#passive-haptic-rehearsal-for-accelerated-piano-skill-acquisition), and [EchoForce](https://tangemicioglu.com/publications/#echoforce-continuous-grip-force-estimation-from-skin-deformation-using-active-acoustic-sensing-on-a-wristband).
