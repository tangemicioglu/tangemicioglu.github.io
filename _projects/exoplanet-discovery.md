title: "Exoplanet Discovery with Machine Learning on Stellar Time Series Data"
excerpt: "Traditionally, exoplanet discovery relies on expert astronomers or models that integrate astronomy domain knowledge. We applied machine learning and feature extraction techniques to get 80% accuracy for stellar light curves in NASA's Mikulski Archive, demonstrating that domain knowledge is no longer necessary for discovery of new exoplanets."
