title: "Assistive Smart Stove for Safer Kitchens"
excerpt: "For elderly people with cognitive impairments, the kitchen can be dangerous. To reduce risks of burns, falling objects and memory lapses in the kitchen, we prototyped an intelligent stovetop appliance and mobile app interface. We conducted a Wizard of Oz study on prototype and collected usability information from interviews, performance, and NASA-TLX."
