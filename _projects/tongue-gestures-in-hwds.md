title: "Tongue Gestures in Head Worn Devices"
excerpt: "Tongue gestures are an accessible and subtle method for interacting with wearables but past studies have used custom hardware with a single sensing modality. At Microsoft Research, we used multimodal sensors in a commercial VR headset and EEG headband to build a 50,000 gesture dataset and real-time classifier. We also invented a new interaction method combining tongue and gaze to enable faster gaze-based selection in hands-free interactions."
