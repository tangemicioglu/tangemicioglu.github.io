title: "Vibrotactile Stimulation for Lower Limb Spasticity"
excerpt: "We are conducting a dual-phase clinical trial on the feasibility of using a wearable vibrotactile stimulation sleeve for post-stroke rehabilitation of spasticity in the leg and foot. In particular, we are investigating the neurophysiological mechanism of vibrotactile stimulation in rehabilitation, and its effect when used in conjunction with gait training."
