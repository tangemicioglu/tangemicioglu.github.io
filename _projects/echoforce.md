title: "EchoForce: Continuous Wearable Grip Force Estimation with Acoustic Sensing"
excerpt: "EchoForce is a wristband using a novel application of acoustic sensing to continuously measure grip force via subtle skin deformations using only a speaker and microphone. EchoForce is inexpensive, does not need calibration, and can be worn and taken off quickly, making it highly practical for wearable grip force measurement in health monitoring and HCI."
