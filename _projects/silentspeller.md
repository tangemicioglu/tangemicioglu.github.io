title: "SilentSpeller: Silent Speech Text Entry using Electropalatography"
excerpt: "Silent speech systems provide a means for communication to people with movement disabilities like muscular dystrophy while preserving privacy. SilentSpeller is the first-ever silent speech system capable of use with a >1000 word vocabulary while in motion. We made a novel text entry system with capacitive tongue sensing from an oral wearable device to enable a privacy-preserving alternative to speech recognition."
