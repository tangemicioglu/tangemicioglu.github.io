title: "Hand Pose Estimation using Convolutional Neural Networks in Stereoscopic Vision"
excerpt: "Estimating hand poses is valuable for gesture interactions and hand tracking but often requires expensive depth cameras. Stereo cameras show multiple perspectives of the hand, allowing depth perception. We created a pipeline for estimating location of hand and finger keypoints with a stereo camera using deep convolutional neural networks."
