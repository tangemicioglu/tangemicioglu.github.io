title: "BreathePulse"
excerpt: "Whereas past guided breathing systems use visual or tactile feedback, we designed BreathePulse, an airflow-based system for reducing respiratory rate more naturally and unobtrusively. We evaluated BreathePulse in an intensive n-back task and provided guidelines for making future guided breathing devices more effortless and comfortable for users."
