title: "Autonomous Navigation for Mobile Robots in Open Terrain"
excerpt: "As part of the software team, I prepared a complete replica of competition in simulation to enable RoboJackets' Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition robots to be tested realistically. I also coded motor control firmware and path planning algorithms to enable more accurate robot motion. Later, as project manager, I supervised the software, electrical and mechanical teams' progress."
