title: "Passive Haptic Learning for Accelerated Learning of Piano"
excerpt: "Learning piano is difficult, especially for older learners with busy lives. Passive haptic learning can reduce time spent practicing piano through instructional tactile cues. We designed a custom vibrotactile haptic glove for daily wear, enabling faster learning of piano skills. I led a group of undergraduate and graduate students in manufacturing glove hardware, designing a web portal and organizing user studies to evaluate performance."
