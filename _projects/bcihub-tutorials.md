title: "BCIhub: A Tutorial Repository by the BCI Society"
excerpt: "The field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is growing rapidly, but there's a lack of reliable learning resources for students and new researchers. As part of my role in the Postdoc & Student Commitee of the BCI Society, I'm creating a public repository of tutorials for teaching various topics in BCI."
