title: "BrainBraille: A Passively Learnable Brain Computer Interface using fNIRS"
excerpt: "We developed a new brain-computer interface using fNIRS to detect attempted motor movement in different regions of the body. Converting attempted motions to language to enable more versatile communication options for people with movement disabilities. For my undergraduate thesis, I explored how transitional gestures may enable higher accuracy and information transfer with brain-computer interfaces."
