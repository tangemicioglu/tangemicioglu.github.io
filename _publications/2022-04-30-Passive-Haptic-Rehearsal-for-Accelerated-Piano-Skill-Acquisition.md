abstract: "Passive haptic learning (PHL) uses vibrotactile stimulation to train piano songs using repetition, even when the recipient of stimulation is focused on other tasks. However, many of the benefits of playing piano cannot be acquired without actively playing the instrument. In this position paper, we posit that passive haptic rehearsal, where active piano practice is assisted by separate sessions of passive stimulation, is of greater everyday use than solely PHL. We propose a study to examine the effects of passive haptic rehearsal for self-paced piano learners and consider how to incorporate passive rehearsal into everyday practice."
