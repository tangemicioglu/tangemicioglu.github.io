abstract: "Human senses are fundamental to how we interpret and interact with the world. Computing devices are increasingly coupled with the human sensory system through interfaces such as smart glasses, earbuds, and wristbands. This opens up opportunities to dynamically mediate, modify, and augment perceptual experiences and physiological processes through multisensory stimulation. These devices go beyond assistive technologies designed for individuals with sensory impairments (e.g., hearing aids) and are now available for everyday use. Applications range from enriching immersive entertainment experiences to supporting well-being through multisensory interventions. The UIST community has been a key venue for introducing many proof-of-concept prototypes in multisensory stimulation. However, gaps remain in systematically understanding how such technologies can be designed, studied, and contextualized in long-term, everyday use. This workshop will examine barriers to transitioning prototypes from proof-of-concepts into systems for real-world use. The session will feature keynote talks, demo sessions, and an interactive device-swap activity where participants exchange and wear different devices during the afternoon session, and conclude with an open discussion to develop implementation frameworks."
