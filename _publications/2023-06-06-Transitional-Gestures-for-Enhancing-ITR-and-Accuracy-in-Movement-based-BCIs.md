abstract: "BCIs using imagined or executed movement enable subjects to communicate by performing gestures in sequential patterns. Conventional interaction methods have a one-to-one mapping between movements and commands but new methods such as BrainBraille have instead used a
pseudo-binary encoding where multiple body parts are tensed simultaneously. However, non-invasive BCI modalities such as EEG and fNIRS have limited spatial specificity, and have difficulty distinguishing simultaneous movements. We propose a new method using transitions in gesture sequences to combinatorially increase possible commands without simultaneous movements. We demonstrate the efficacy of transitional gestures in a pilot fNIRS study where accuracy increased from 81% to 92% when distinguishing transitions of two movements instead of two movements independently. We calculate ITR for a potential transitional version of BrainBraille, where ITR would increase from 143bpm to 218bpm."
