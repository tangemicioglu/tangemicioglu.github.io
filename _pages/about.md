Hello and welcome! I'm Tan Gemicioglu, currently a third year undergraduate in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm an undergraduate researcher in Georgia Tech's Contextual Computing Group, advised by wearable computing pioneer [Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm). I'm interested in developing **symbiotic interfaces** that can integrate with their users' physiology while learning alongside them to enable new abilities and enhance existing ones. My research primarily focuses on wearable technology for **new communication modalities** and **faster skill acquisition** but broadly draws from influences across human-computer interaction, machine learning and neuroscience.

I am also the Vice President of Georgia Tech's premier competitive robotics organization, [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/) where I direct the operations of 400 students in building, designing and programming robots for national and international competitions. Previously, I've been a teaching assistant for [CS6601: Artificial Intelligence](http://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6601-artificial-intelligence) in Georgia Tech's Online Master's Program and developed web-based server infrastructure and data analytics platforms at Oracle.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Mediterranean-Asian fusion food, and I'm an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy (especially those who lie between the genres!).
