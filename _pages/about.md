Hello and welcome! I'm Tan Gemicioglu, currently a second year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in developing **symbiotic systems** which help us while learning from us and with us. More specifically, I work on **wearable technologies** and **autonomous robots** while developing **artificial intelligence** to improve their interaction with the world and our interaction with them.

I'm an undergraduate researcher in Georgia Tech's Contextual Computing Group, advised by [Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm). I'm also a teaching assistant for [CS6601, Artificial Intelligence](http://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6601-artificial-intelligence) at Georgia Tech's Online Master's Program. I lead the RoboNav team of [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/), where we design, build and program mobile robots for the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and University Rover Challenge with a multidisciplinary group of 60+ students.
