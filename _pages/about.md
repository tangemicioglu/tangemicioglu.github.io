Hello and welcome! I'm Tan Gemicioglu (pronounced Ton Geh-me-gee-oh-loo), a PhD Student in [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, located at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) in New York City. I am co-advised by [Tanzeem Choudhury](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/tanzeem-choudhury/) in the [People-Aware Computing Lab](https://pac.cs.cornell.edu/) and [Cheng Zhang](http://www.czhang.org/) in the [SciFi Lab](https://www.scifilab.org/).

My research focuses on how we can make healthcare effortless, reducing the difficulty of staying healthy for everyone. I design implicit health interventions that demand minimal attention and develop passive sensing technologies that can measure clinically relevant biosignals. By integrating these approaches, I aim to develop closed-loop wearable technology that monitors and modulates our health continuously to unobtrusively maintain well-being. My work broadly draws from influences across human-computer interaction, machine learning and neuroscience. My research has been published in top human-computer interaction venues such as ACM CHI and UbiComp.
<!-- I am interested in combining sensors and haptics to develop wearable technology that monitors and modulates physical or behavioral health without requiring attention. Contrary to current commercial and clinical health devices, I aim to minimize the need for daily tasks and reminders for health improvements. Towards this end, I've designed brain-computer interfaces and haptic gloves for daily wear while broadly drawing from past research in human-computer interaction, machine learning and neuroscience. My research has been published in top human-computer interaction venues such as ACM CHI and UbiComp. -->
<!-- I'm interested in developing **symbiotic interfaces**, devices that integrate with their users' physiology while learning alongside them to augment their abilities. I study and design wearable technology using sensors and haptics for **new interaction techniques** and **faster skill acquisition**, broadly drawing from influences across human-computer interaction, machine learning and neuroscience. My research has been published in top human-computer interaction venues such as ACM CHI and UbiComp. -->

I serve as the [BCI Society](https://bcisociety.org/) Postdoc and Student Committee Chair and as a member of the [Futuring SIGCHI Committee](https://sigchi.org/people/committees/#futuring-sigchi-committee). 

Previously, I did my undergraduate at Georgia Tech, where I built haptic gloves and subtle interfaces as a research assistant for wearable computing pioneer [Dr. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm). I've also worked with the [Audio and Acoustics group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/audio-and-acoustics-research-group/) at Microsoft Research, investigating brain-computer interfaces for VR/AR and tongue interactions.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Mediterranean-Asian fusion food and I'm an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy.
