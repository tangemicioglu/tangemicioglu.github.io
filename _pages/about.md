Hello and welcome! I'm Tan Gemicioglu, currently a third year undergraduate in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm a researcher in Georgia Tech's Contextual Computing Group, advised by wearable computing pioneer [Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm). I'm interested in developing **symbiotic interfaces** that can integrate with their users' physiology while learning alongside them to enable new abilities and enhance existing ones. My research primarily focuses on wearable technology for **new communication modalities** and **faster skill acquisition** but broadly draws from influences across human-computer interaction, machine learning and neuroscience.

This summer, I'll be joining the [Audio and Acoustics group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/audio-and-acoustics-research-group/) at Microsoft Research, investigating brain-computer interfaces. I also currently serve as a member of the [BCI Society](https://bcisociety.org/)'s Postdoc and Student Committee where I am organizing an open science initiative to establish a common repository of BCI learning resources. 

I was previously the Vice President of Georgia Tech's premier competitive robotics organization, [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/) where I directed the operations of 400 students in building, designing and programming robots for national and international competitions. I've also been a teaching assistant for [CS6601: Artificial Intelligence](http://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6601-artificial-intelligence) in Georgia Tech's Online Master's Program as well as CS3001: Computing and Society.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Mediterranean-Asian fusion food and I'm an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy.
